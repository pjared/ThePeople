I've realized that it would be a good idea for me to document what i'm doing while i'm doing it. So far I have already created all of the views, done my first drafts at creating the database and some of the seeders.

Today i'm going to try to work with setting up the controllers and see what happens when I try to display some of the seeded data. I'm going to fix the db and the seedrs.
