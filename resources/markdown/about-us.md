# About Us
For now this is really an "about me" section, since it's currently just one person running this ship.

## Who Am I?
My name is Jared Pacheco, I spent 2018-2022 studying Computer Science at Brigham Young University. After spending the last 2 years working part-time as a web developer, I started ComnRep, LLC. in June of 2022. I still plan on finishing school, but after a life changing event I decided that I could do that over time while I venture out to start my first tech business.

## ComnRep, LLC.
This is a for-profit company. I plan on creating services for political candidates and groups that will help them succeed in their endeavors. 

### Data Collection, the Privacy Policy and the ToS
I don't really have the time (as of August 1st when I am writing this up) to create a proper privacy policy and the other legal documents. I instead found free templates online that I went ahead and filled in to create a basic ToS and Privacy Policy. I plan on creating features that will ask you for your home state and age range. I would like to show the candidates the demographics that they are appealing to in their state. I have no intentions of selling this data to 3rd party agencies. Please do not contact me if that's what you want. The only persons who will receive your "data" (your ballot votes and your flags) will be the candidates in your state. I hope that this will give candidates a better feeling about how they're doing in their election race.

### How Does This Company Make Money?
Political groups and candidates will pay a small fee for their "profile" to be hosted on the site. In the future, I will create tools for helping candidates see how well their profile is doing. This includes seeing what users are flagging and constructive critisizms the users are leaving about their profile.

### Our Mission
Voter data is extremely sensitive. However, voter data is an extremely useful tool for candidates to gauge how well they are doing in their races. ComnRep aims to provide an ecosystem where voter data is used how it should be. To help the candidates adjust their stances, rethink opinions, and better represent you, The People. 

We also hope that candidates will feel more responsibility for their promises, stances on controversial opinions, and the laws they pass in office. A candidate's profile might help them get into office, but it might also be the reason they do not keep office if they don't live up to what they've promised.

## Thank you, ComnRep, LLC.
