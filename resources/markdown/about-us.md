# About Us

## ComnRep, LLC.
This is a for-profit company. We are on creating services for political candidates and groups that will help them succeed in their endeavors. 

### Data Collection, the Privacy Policy and the ToS
The team behind ThePeople have no intentions of selling this data to 3rd party agencies. Please do not contact me if that's what you want. 
The candidates in your state will be able to view your ballot votes and your flags anonymously. We hope that this will give candidates the ability to gauge how they are doing in the race, and shift their views, if needed, to better represent The People.

### How Does This Company Make Money?
Political groups and candidates will pay a small fee for their "profile" to be hosted on the site.

### Our Mission
Voter data is extremely sensitive. However, voter data is an extremely useful tool for candidates to gauge how well they are doing in their races. ComnRep aims to provide an ecosystem where voter data is used how it should be. To help the candidates adjust their stances, rethink opinions, and better represent you, The People. 

We also hope that candidates will feel more responsibility for their promises, stances on controversial opinions, and the laws they pass in office. A candidate's profile might help them get into office, but it might also be the reason they do not keep office if they don't live up to what they've promised.

## Thank you, ComnRep, LLC.
