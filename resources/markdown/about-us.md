# About Us

## ComnRep, LLC.
This is a for-profit company. We plan on creating services for political candidates and groups that will help them succeed in their endeavors. 

### Our Mission
We hope to provide the data from politics in a non-partisan, simple, and accessible manner. We had our own struggles obtaining campaign finances and legislation from the both state and federal governments. We believe technology can provide transparency into government, and this transparency will ultimately: prevent corruption, increase people's confidence in their choice of vote, and allow any person feel like they understand what's going on in government.

Voter data is extremely sensitive. However, voter data is an extremely useful tool for candidates to gauge how well they are doing in their races. ComnRep aims to provide an ecosystem where voter data is used how it should be: help candidates gauge how they're doing in races, give candidates data to assess their own opinions, and ultimately better represent you, The People. 

We also hope that candidates will feel more responsibility for their promises, upholding their opinions, and carefully consider laws they pass in office. A candidate's profile might help them get into office, but it could also be the reason they do not keep office if they don't follow through with what they campaigned on.

### How Does This Company Make Money?
Political groups and candidates will pay a small fee for their "profile" to be hosted on the site.

### What About My Data?
The team behind ThePeople have no intentions of selling this data to 3rd party agencies. Please do not contact us if that's what you're looking for. 
The candidates in your state will be able to view your ballot votes and your flags anonymously.

### Future Plans
We have plans to democratize the website in the future. We would like to allow for people to vote on the most important problems in their state, and candidates will have to provide solutions. We plan on providing much more interaction with voters and candidates, such as the ability to ask questions they have. We also hope that we can get political groups involved to host candidates for campaigning, pose questions for elections, and allow for voters to find political groups for them.

Of course in order to do this we need the support of the public. We are actively looking for funding to expand and be prepared for the next elections.

## Thank you, ComnRep, LLC.
