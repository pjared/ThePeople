                        "stance" => "  According to the World Bank, America has the highest health expenditures per capita. Yet despite paying the most of any nation, we are only ranked 35th by the Global Health Index, which considers 169 countries. Many believe the solution is more spending, government-mandated health plans, and price-fixing.



                        According to government estimates, millions of Americans travel to Mexico for cheaper prescription drugs and medical procedures each year. Why is it that American pharmacies and doctors cannot compete? Is it because of greedy companies? Is it because we do not have socialized medicine? The solution to high healthcare costs would be to remove the cause of high prices, not chase those high prices with more spending. Restoring a free market in the healthcare industry where doctors and hospitals compete for patients would solve our healthcare cost crisis.

                        Remove regulations that suppress new drugs and procedures. Individuals have the right to try and pursue any treatment they wish, with or without the government's consent.

                        Give doctors the freedom to build and establish practices and facilities where needed and repeal the government's lengthy and expensive permitting process.

                        Reform the tort system to protect doctors, hospitals, drug manufacturers, and medical device companies from frivolous lawsuits.

                        Vote no for Medicare/Medicaid expansions and work with congressional colleagues to introduce/sponsor legislation to enact the three stated measures above.

                        I would support giving dollars spent on healthcare directly to Americans, allowing them to spend them on their healthcare, and supporting the systems that best help them reach their health needs.

                        I would also be interested in a single-payer model. Most studies show significant cost savings, particularly on drugs and administrative costs. My only constraint on this system would be that we do not spend more than we already do on Medicaid/Medicare. It must deliver on the cost-saving promise!


                        Another ignored cause of poor American health and lower life expectancies is the typical American diet and the lack of movement in our daily lives. We could help our country return to healthier and simpler foods by making it easier for small farmers to sell their products directly to the people in their communities. Repealing USDA regulations that only allow large corporate farms to succeed would revitalize small family farms and help Americans return to a healthier diet.



                        As for movement, we are Libertarians, and we won't force you to be more active. Only you have the power to choose healthier outcomes!",

                        Korea. Vietnam. Iraq. Afghanistan. Washington continually wastes American blood and wealth in conflicts that have nothing to do with our Nation's defense. How does jumping from one foreign conflict to the next, selling arms into active war zones, expanding military treaties in distant lands, and ultimately bankrupting America, make our country or the world safer?
                        We should seek a state of neutrality, open dialogue, and free trade to build friendship, economic prosperity, and peace throughout the land.
                        The current crisis in Ukraine highlights the failures of American foreign policy. The fall of the Iron Curtain was a great moment for liberty. The USSR coffers were exhausted from failed central planning policies and the decade-long civil war in Afghanistan. The right of people to move freely between countries and dictate the course of their own lives was being realized.
                        Instead of using this momentous occasion to develop friendship and economic prosperity with Russia and all of Eastern Europe, we expanded NATO eastward, placed weapons and nuclear arms into European countries, and dumped millions of dollars to influence Ukrainian and Georgian elections. America carried out the militarization of former Soviet states in the supposed name of peace and democracy. In actuality, it was the vain desire to build a political legacy and weaken Russia. Yet we now see that Ukrainians, not Washington politicians, are harvesting the bitter fruits. We must make peace with the world and stop the pattern of war profiteering and meddling in other countries' domestic politics.

                            I would vote no for any military action that does not directly tie to the defense of our Nation.

                            I will vote no to arms deals to countries involved in active conflicts, such as the billions of dollars of weapons we sell to the Saudi government, which in turn are being used against Yemen, giving rise to one of the worst humanitarian crises of our day.

                            I will work to normalize trade and walk back sanctions with our \"enemies\" and instead seek to establish free trade and diplomacy to achieve peace on the world stage.

                            I would also seek unilateral denuclearization with the other nuclear powers to walk the world back from the nuclear precipice. ",

That risk is a natural check to speculative enterprises and deals. We no longer have a free market when the government subsidizes industries, limits choice, and passes trillion-dollar bailout packages. It is called crony capitalism, and it benefits a few at the expense of the general population.

                        We are currently in a period of record inflation and shortages. According to a recent report by the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, the average cost of recent inflation per household in the Mountain West region exceeds $500 per month. For families living on a fixed income, that increase is devastating. You quickly realize the empty promise of government stimulus when it evaporates after a few months of inflation costs. Inflation erases the value of savings and is particularly devastating to our senior citizens.

                        I would vote no to bailout packages for industries. Let the free market pick winners and losers, not the government.

                        I would support the repeal of stifling regulatory laws that make it nearly impossible for small businesses to compete with much larger and richer corporations.

                        I would also work with congressional colleagues to introduce legislation that would repeal tax dollars subsidizing any industry sector such as manufacturing, energy production, and agriculture. Government subsidies of industries are antithetical to a free market and destroy the natural competition that keeps prices low. A quick google search pulls up many examples of politicians profiting from these very subsidies. For example, VP Al Gore and the company Silver Springs Network in which he heavily invested received federal subsidies of $560m. Mr. Gore claims that every penny he made off of these investments went back into his non-profit, but no politician or industry should profit off the backs of the populace.

                        I would also support legislation forbidding members of congress from trading stocks. Public servants are elected to serve, not enrich their portfolios.",

Public funding of education is, in my mind, one of the best things our Nation has done to support widespread literacy, numeracy, and the opportunity to explore new ideas. I realize this is not an orthodox, libertarian view. However, before discussing defunding schools, we should focus on the tax dollars spent on bailouts, subsidies, and weapons proliferation in much larger quantities than those spent on education.

                        In Washington, I would support legislation that returns education decisions to states and a voucher system where federal dollars follow the students. A voucher system would allow institutions to compete for those students, leading to better outcomes in the public and private sectors. ",

That is between the individual and their care provider. Studies have shown that abortion bans do not reduce abortion rates; they only make abortion riskier. Those with means travel to states where the practice is legal, and those without means resort to more desperate actions. If you want to reduce abortion rates, increase access to family planning services through doctors, midwives, and nurses, and increase education about and access to effective contraceptives.

                        I will fully support legislation that:

                        Removes undue burdens to professionals seeking to establish quality care for women and eliminates barriers between women and doctors, midwives, nurses, and doulas.

                        Expands a women's access to contraceptives without the need for a prescription.


                        I will support Supreme Court nominees that protect the right of the individual to make these decisions for themselves. I support any individual's right to peacefully and tastefully engage with and advocate for choices beyond abortion, such as adoption for profit.

These efforts also harm the ability of Americans to protect themselves and their families, disproportionately hurting minorities and those living in high-crime areas.

Their innovation and advances in technology have transformed the quality of life of people throughout the world, including millions of Americans.As technology improves and new and growing markets emerge, there will always be a temptation in Washington to expand the federal government's regulatory role over the private sector and attempt to centrally control our innovation. However, Senator Lee believes a responsible approach to technology policy is one where the federal government restrains itself to its limited constitutional authorities and even then only acts in a manner that is narrowly tailored to address the specific challenge. This authority must be exercised carefully because government intervention tends to hinder, rather than empower, American innovators and can insulate the largest, most powerful companies from their competitors. As tech companies acquire more power and exercise more control over our access to information, our antitrust enforcers must play a more active role to promote and protect competition.As the internet has grown and transformed how Americans share information, purchase and transport goods, and consume news, the federal government has needed and will continue to need to revisit debates over government regulation of speech, corporate conduct, competition, and transportation. If we want reforms to successfully combat discriminatory action, ensure competition, and crack down on obscene content to protect our children, all while preserving a fair marketplace and continued innovation, Senator Lee believes Congress must engage in robust debate, exercise its limited, proper role, and consider how its actions may lead to other consequences.",

He does not think it gives the federal government blanket authority to micromanage the country's economy.Congress should allow American businesses and families to thrive without the burdensome hand of government getting in the way. Workers succeed when businesses have access to the capital they need, and capital becomes more readily available when government is not overregulating or spending beyond its means.Throughout our nation's history, Americans have proven they have an innovative and entrepreneurial spirit to better not only their own lives but the lives of their neighbors, local communities, and the world at large. Senator Lee believes Americans, not government, have built businesses, employed workers, supported families, and provided the ideas to improve the lives of each generation.The federal government can appropriately help support the continuation of these successes by removing unnecessary regulations, increasing access to foreign markets through free and fair trade agreements, simplifying our tax code and making it more competitive, protecting the integrity of the dollar, and protecting American workers by ensuring our legal immigration system supplements our workforce only where there is a gap.Jobs also depend on free markets, and free markets require vigilance to protect them from anticompetitive monopolies.

                        "stance" => "Access to affordable, high-quality healthcare is a critical component of a productive and vibrant society. Unfortunately, due to government intrusion, many Americans cannot afford the care and treatment they need.Each of our 50 states has different populations with different health-care needs, so Senator Lee believes there is no reason all Americans should be forced to purchase the same essential health benefits package while shopping for health insurance. Good health-care policy is flexible and customizable, since what is essential to one family or individual may not be essential to another.While Senator Lee opposes the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as Obamacare, he believes the problems of federal intervention in the health-care sector started decades earlier. Exempting employer-provided health insurance from taxation was one of the first issues that inappropriately incentivized the employer-sponsored model over the individual consumer model. For many Americans, this has resulted in fewer insurance choices and has tied them to their jobs.While immediately ending the tax deduction for healthcare provided through an employer would be unsettling for many Americans, Senator Lee believes its reform must be a topic for debate. But possibly the most important health-care reform needed is a liberalization of health savings accounts. Freeing these accounts from federal government restrictions could allow Americans to save more for their health-care needs, allow them to transfer from jobs without losing their insurance, and equip them to be more active and engaged consumers. With a more informed consumer base, its influence over the market could truly turn things around, improving quality, cost, and accessibility.Additionally, Senator Lee believes Congress must reform the Food and Drug Administration to make medical devices and drugs (and their generics) available sooner and at a lower cost. Medicaid to ensure it is targeted for the truly vulnerable who are unable to provide for themselves, such as children, pregnant women, and the disabled; and the Department of Health and Human Services so that all life, including the lives of the unborn and the elderly, is always protected.",

Therefore, it's important that families have choices whether that be home schooling, public school, charter school, private school, etc. and the federal government should not incentivize one over another.While the four-year formalized college education is held as the gold standard by many, it really shouldn't be. For some it is absolutely the right route, but for others, higher education may not be necessary or they may be better served and prepared for work through an apprenticeship program or short-term, highly focused instruction. Again, Senator Lee believes choice and options are important. At the end of the day, higher education should prepare the upcoming generation for success in today's workforce. For this to be accomplished and the cost of post-secondary education to decrease, greater transparency, accountability, and competition are needed.",

In crafting the U.S. Constitution, our Founders understood the immense power and control vested in the ability to raise and command an Army and Navy as well as to declare war. While the President serves as Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces, Congress is the only branch with the power to declare war and raise a military through the power of the purse. This authority was given to Congress because it is the branch held most accountable by the people.Congress and the President also share the responsibility of engaging with foreign nations. Congress is explicitly charged with the power to regulate foreign commerce, and the Senate's power to ratify treaties and offer advice and consent on ambassador nominations serves as a check on the President's diplomatic power.Over the years, the checks and balances and appropriate division of this power has weakened, resulting in a concentration of both defense and foreign relations powers in the executive branch. Therefore, one of Senator Lee's missions is to reassert and reinvigorate the constitutional role of Congress in shaping U.S. military and foreign policy. He continues to lead major legislation on war powers, military spending, and restraining international institutions. He believes very strongly that actions that would put American blood and treasure on the line must be debated and discussed where the risks and benefits can be carefully weighed and the American people can influence such decisions through their elected leaders. The U.S. Congress is the only body that meets both parameters.Another major component of protecting our national security and sovereignty is securing our borders. We must know who is entering and exiting our country to protect Americans domestically and ensure that we enforce our immigration laws so as not to incentivize those who want to enter the United States to do so illegally.While the Framers understood the importance of national security, they also understood that protecting civil liberties by limiting the government's power to search and spy on its citizens was an essential protection against tyranny. As James Madison said when framing a government where men govern men the great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to control the governed; and the next place, oblige it to control itself. Senator Lee believes the federal government must follow warrant requirements enshrined in the Fourth Amendment to protect Americans against unauthorized government surveillance and preserve the civil liberties granted by our Constitution.",

Unfortunately, the federal government has not held up its end of the bargain and has retained vast amounts of Utah acreage limiting Utahns' ability to maintain, conserve, recreate, and responsibly produce on the lands within their own state.Senator Lee believes much of this land should be transferred to the state as promised so that Utah's natural resources can be better managed to conserve the land, provide for the state's constituents, and serve its multi-use purposes. Utah has a great track record of responsibly managing public lands and caring for its environment, while ensuring economic prosperity for its communities, families, and industries dependent on access to the land, like agriculture, energy, and outdoor recreation.As Utah's population grows, access to the land will become even more urgent and necessary. Some will need to accommodate affordable housing, roads to ease congestion, schools, etc; other acreage that contains critical minerals and energy sources will need to be responsibly and safely tapped; and finally, others will need to be preserved for fishing, hunting, climbing, and other outdoor sports that bring families together and are simply a way of life in the west.Additionally, Senator Lee believes the federal government should not pick winners and losers in the energy sector or agriculture sector and that the free market and the demands of the public will result in the most efficient use of funds, reliable supply of energy to fuel the country and food to feed our population, and innovative solutions to keep our environment clean and food supply safe.

Every individual deserves respect and protection to freely exercise and live out their religious and moral beliefs without fear of oppression or persecution as guaranteed by the First Amendment to our Constitution.The importance of the family and the social capital that comes from active, local communities motivates much of Senator Lee's work everything from tax policy to welfare policy to criminal justice reform. He believes America must renew civil society and the federal government should not crowd-out civil society's role or Americans' participation in associational life and the institutions that secure it.For instance, Senator Lee believes the tax code should not penalize marriage, our entitlement system should not penalize parents, and our criminal code should provide flexibility to judges in sentencing non-violent offenders. Ensuring that the federal government places married couples and parents on a level-playing field as other Americans and provides those that have been convicted of non-violent crimes the opportunity to rehabilitate themselves and return to their families and communities are important reforms that Senator Lee has made a focus of his work.",
