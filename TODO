# TODAY
- Candidate Page
    - Link thumbnails in Youtube
    - Turn Campaign donors into pie graph
- Finish Controversial opinions list
    - Controversial opions, candidateStance
- Make about us page
- Need to do "like" search for location inputs & Error handling
- Make query builders for government websites for:
    - Positions in office
    - Laws voted on in office
- Make another branch to convert everything to tailwind

- Whenever a candidate is made, make sure to generate a list of opinions with null stances
- Ballot page look like textured paper
- Save the checkmark for the planned vote
- Add icons to explain the opinion


# MVP
- State input on ballot page needs to fit text, so does ZIP and City
- When highlighting needed location inputs, don't highlight if one is filled out
- If someone inputs a city/zip but clicks on a state level role, need to get the state for location
    - Might need to make this as another database
- Implement a handler for when the ballot has not been initialized

# User Pivots
- Implement badges that appear during candidate hover & a key
    - Badges should also be on profile
    - Badges should only appear after verifcation, so politicians feel encouraged to join
    - Each badge needs to be it's own color
- Hovering over a law gives a summary, might need to find another site that does this
- Remove dropdown for controversial opinions and list first
- Redo appearance of candidate details (name, email, etc.)

# User Login Capability
- Add ability to register to ComnRep
- Add login throttling
    - https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/authentication#redirecting-unauthenticated-users
- Implement some kind of authentication system
    - https://github.com/robsontenorio/laravel-keycloak-guard?ref=madewithlaravel.com
    - https://github.com/ory/hydra - seems to be open source but not for enterprise
## Prompts to sign up
- Add sign up prompts for the following (https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/authentication#redirecting-unauthenticated-users)
    - Checking on ballot
    - Flagging

# Choosing a level of office
- Also need to add in city council?
- City input doesn't seem to work for some reason

# Adding Politicians
- Configure API tokens for them
    - https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/authentication#redirecting-unauthenticated-users

# User Creation
## Users
- Make users implement state, if state is ever changed need to delete their votes and flags 
    - Users can't transfer abuse
## Politicians
- Need some kind of method for confirmation of the person. 

# Views

## Home Page

## Candidate Page
- Find a proper video embedding package for composer
- Implement a carosel for the videos

## Ballot Page
- When hovering a person
    - Create stickers under a candidate in the ballot so people can see basic info. 
    - Able to click to go to the candidate's page

## My Profile Page

### Personal Information
- Allow the user to put in their zip, city, or state
    - Autofill this for them on the page? Or just make the buttons clickable


### Jump back into
- Have a right side tab that will allow the user to go back to their study instead of manually doing the input
    - Use a login cookie so the data can be grabbed
    
### Later Things
- Finish autocomplete for ZIP and cities



# Politican Page
- Dip toes in water with service injection to display politician metrics
    - https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/container
## Submitting images
- Need to make sure that images have 1:1 aspect ratios

# Admin Page
- Look into pyscript to see if I should use matplotlib to display graphs for politician side

# General Security
- Need to find out how to store the images without every image being public to anyone
- Need an analysis on all HTTP requests to make sure I use post when necessary

# Before going live
- Find out which login service is cheap, and will allow most connection for user data to sell
- Add validation errors for everything
    - https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/validation#quick-displaying-the-validation-errors
- Need to get down with service injection. 
    - https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/container
- Write Robots.txt file in public
- Add Breadcrumbs : https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.4/components/#breadcrumbs

# Future things
- Implement ability to flag. Have a flag comparison page
    - Find out how to save these flags by politician
- Check out livewire for dynamic components
    - https://laravel-livewire.com/docs/2.x/quickstart
        - A pretty good starting guide https://www.sitepoint.com/laravel-livewire-getting-started/ 
        - Another one https://dev.to/osejudith/lntroduction-to-laravel-livewire-aif
- All "location_type" are pretty much just enums ("state", "city", or "county"), make their table entry only the length of the longest string
- Share buttons for social media
    - Interactive filters for social media, such as the head tilts
    - Can also use this to skim more data and give better recommendations, "We think you will like this candidate more"

# Database Redesign
- Might need to just make one table for geographic locations, then get that ID. It will have a location id itself and a location_type
    - Won't have to include both fields on the any other table, just the ID for that one

- Make the seeder.md table
# Other programming stuff to look up
- Shortcut that will copy a line and paste it into current
