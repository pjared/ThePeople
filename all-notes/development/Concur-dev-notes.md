# Welcome To Solis, inc.
This file will teach you how we do concurrent development here at our company. Notice that this documentation comes with physical steps that you need to take in order to get started in working here.

## Setting up your environment

### VSCode
We have installed VSCode on your machine purposefully. 

## Procedure for writing code
This section will overview the code writing process here. Your manager will check in with you to make sure that you are following this process as you continue to work here.

### Documentation
Every developer needs to have their own:
    - mistakes documentation file

Need to use git blame for adding color coding to the mistakes doc file, that way developers can go talk to each other for help with mistakes that they might be stuck on

# TODO
- For each department that gets hired, the documentation should include puzzles that the employee needs to solve to move on.
    - For example, security devs should have a series of increasingly challenging cryptography exercises that tell them what to do next
    - I can also include geo-caching where you have to go talk to another dev in another dept, see your boss' boss, to get the next clue from them
