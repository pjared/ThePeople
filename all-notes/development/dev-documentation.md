I've realized that it would be a good idea for me to document what i'm doing while i'm doing it. So far I have already created all of the views, done my first drafts at creating the database and some of the seeders.

Today i'm going to try to work with setting up the controllers and see what happens when I try to display some of the seeded data. I'm going to fix the db and the seedrs.

## 1
Just created the git repo and pushed everything I made to master. I made a dev branch and plan on working from here

## 2
In order to display the data i'm modifying the controller
### 2.1 
I'm creating a test for the ballot controller so that the functions can remain the same
### 2.1
Test is written and i've added onto the controller. I also changed the view to get the list of ballotees.

I decided yesterday that I would instead add all of the admin stuff to a different site that will still edit the original DB
This way I don't have one site where hackers can get on and try to penetrate the normal site
