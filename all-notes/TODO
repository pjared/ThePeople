# Branch (Final Urgent) - Testing
- Set up a sail repo to run tests

- Candidate application might be broken due to party update

- Migrate production DB and make sure admin sites are working

- Need to do testing on the candidate side, but can wait for the admin side for later

- Test the following:
    - Candidate creating their stances

- Error handling for permalink unique
    - Need to error handle check for error handling in all wires with tests

- Need to make a production test
    - Candidate ballot assignment on prod is 500, need to error check for no ballots

- Make a single candidate that I can run all tests for viewing profile on

- Make sure that user can save their votes for a ballot

- End to end tests (dusk) for the following
    - User registers, then applies to become a candidate
        -> User is accepted
            -> User becomes a candidate, Fills out some info
        -> User edits their candidate profile, adds necessary info
            -> User cannot show
            -> User does not show on ballot
        -> Admin assigns Candidate to a ballot
        -> Candidate hits show
            -> Candidate appears on the ballot
            -> User can flag information from the candidate
    

# Quick QoL
- Put info button after candidate promises to explain how certain offices cannot promise immediate reform, but stand as a voice

# Branch (Urgent) - Production
- Need to make a sitemap for google, should use spatie
    - https://github.com/spatie/laravel-sitemap

- Make sure database is empty and push all changes
- Run lighthouse (on chrome) for site optimizations

- Optimize images, can use imageoptim.
- Make a favicon for the browser
- Make sure it works on multiple broswers
- Make sure to set up analytics for marketing
- Use laravel forge for now, but then move to vapor
- Can use laravel envoyer for 0 downtime updates
- uptime monitoring for notifying when site is down (uptimeRobot)

- Switch to forge to work with queues

# Branch (High) - Model Safety
- Make sure that all model properties are in correct places (guarded vs fillable)
- Make sure that each model is being created correctly to reflect this
- Make sure that all attributes are correctly hidden like email, etc.
- Do some research into what attributes are necessary to hide

# Branch (High) - Mobile Screen Support
- Add mobile support to the following pages
    - Home
    - Ballot show
    - candidate show

# Branch (High) - Large Screen Support
- Add large screen support to the following pages

# Branch (Urgent) - Socialite
- Allow users to sign in with their gmail accounts

# Branch (High) - Manual Candidate Creation
- Need to make an admin page to create the candidates profile if none of them decide to sign up
- After signing up, you can assign candidates to their existing ID to replace their profile with the correct information

# Branch (Low) - Information Rework
- Ballots should have an information type. This will be a list of information that appears on the ballot
- When a candidate runs for a certain position, different wording/information needs to appear
    - Controversial Opinions depend on the ballot, not the location
    - "Promises" should be "Promises to stand for the following beliefs" when dealing with congress
        - Might work around this by saying "This candidate promises to accomplish something in office, or promises to stand for the following beliefs"



# Branch - Candidate Flags
- A proper library for commenting/liking
    - https://github.com/beyondcode/laravel-comments.git
- Put flag comparison page on candidate profile page???
    - Should do an above hover to choose color
    - Look for a library that does that same thing as kindle/apple book note (or scripture)

- Show users a page of flags for their ballots

- On hover, add the number of red/green/nuetral flags
 
# Branch - Admin Pages Rework
- Consider getting a real admin panel (Free)
    - https://litstack.io/
    - https://www.creative-tim.com/product/soft-ui-dashboard-laravel-livewire/?ref=sudl-readme
- Need to make an admin & candiate layout

- Search bar for Admin pages
    - "Candidates Placed"

- Need to add banners to admin pages
- Edit opinions needs to be renamed to ballot opinions

- Create tests for all admin pages

- Admin Livewire Tests
    - User does show his profile
    - Approve new candidate
    - Candidate Ballot Assignment
    - Create a ballot
    - Permalinks


# Branch - High web traffic
- In create ballot (Don't need this until large use of site):
    - Show existing locations, office, and ballots as it's being typed
- Look into laravel Octane and swoole

# Branch - Sharing
- set up open graph meta tags when I implement share buttons

# General Lists
- Make a "show more" component
    - Use in stances, bio, and promises

- User Votes needs an isValid? Or do I just want to check the state that the user has included

- Make a setting to change whether or not the dropdown indicators appear
    - The dropdowns on the opinions make the page a lot less intuitive
- Candidates show support for certain bills (The company creates)
- Can message the candidate from the site, but then we can use the message data to see what people feel about the candidate

- Put a link to state government


- Need to either paginate the candidates or make the elements scrollabe
    - This includes the ballot list
- "See who's running for" is slightly too fast at the end (Only on first time)

- Carousel focus should not refocus the page

- Need to write an SQL script that will be able to refresh tables and save candidates and new user ID's in case of bad migration

- Find another way to generate badges for the candidate

- Signing in should take back to most recent page

- Add a search bar for users to find candidates
    - Look into caching to implement this

- Print out/save list of planned votes

- As candidate profile gets more detailed (graphs, nicer displays, etc.), componetize each section

- Show flag count under candidate in ballot for signed in users

- tooltip hover to see the description of opinions

- Give badges actual icons
    - Add icons next to opinions, act as tooltips - these icons will match the badges on candidates

- Need to make info tags for everything on the site

- Make better videos to show the candidates how to create a profile.

- Make admin home page into a grid

- Allow users to choose a profile photo?

- Set Opinion votes amount (hardcoded for now)

- Candidate show blade
    - Make candidate bio look better

- Add a button to go to profile page from profile and edit page

- Change ballot card
    - Daisy component "hero"
    - Figure out the profile picture look

- Make sure to actually block users from profile photos.

## Hard
- CandidateEditProfile
    - Promises should show up immediately (this is a tough one)

- Need to get down with service injection. 
    - https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/container

# Admin Page - Future additions
- Decide how to handle rejected candidates
    - Have a search bar to unreject
- Each admin page needs to be componetized so creation of models is it's own wire
- The following pages need to have null checks
    - Candidate edit page needs to have a check for when a person accesses the link without a candidate
    - Admin/candidate-assignment

- Pagination for all model lists
- Admin Page for:
    - Generate a QR code (Do this with official logo later, for now just use some random thing)
- ALLOW USER TO SHARE CANDIDATE PERMALINK WITH A SHARE BUTTON (should include flags?)

- On admin create ballot, add in list generation as the person attempts to 
    - create a new location, ballot, or office

- Finish Candidate Ballot assignment
    - Ballot search bar
- Approving a candidate should bring you to a new page only for assigning them a ballot.

# Candidate Teams
- Do this after site launch, make teams work, look at sites below for help
    - https://npratley.net/disabling-personal-teams-in-laravel-8-and-jetstream-1fd083593e08/
    - https://laracasts.com/discuss/channels/code-review/proper-way-to-disable-personal-teams-in-jetstream?page=1#reply=668759

    - Create a team for the user with https://laracasts.com/discuss/channels/code-review/jetstream-how-to-programmatically-create-a-user-and-team 
- Finish logic for whether or not someone can create a team in [Team Policy::create](app/Policies/TeamPolicy.php)
    - Candidates can create ONE team

# MAIN TODO
- Make about us page

- Programs for scraping/handling downloads off of gov't site
    - Laws voted on in office
    - Campaign Donations

- Flash error messages on failure to update info in candidate profile edit

- Allow for friends to share their flags

# User Pivots
- Badges should also be on profile??
- Each badge needs to be it's own color
- Hovering over a law gives a summary, might need to find another site that does this

# Views

## Home Page

## Candidate Page
- Polish up the candidate campaign videos
- Implement a carosel for the videos

## Ballot Page
- Make this look like textured paper

## My Profile Page

### Personal Information
- Allow the user to put in their zip, city, or state
    - Autofill this for them on the page? Or just make the buttons clickable
- Need to track amount of time a user spends on a page for candidate stats

### Jump back into
- Have a right side tab that will allow the user to go back to their study instead of manually doing the input
    - Use a cookie (don't store in db)

# Politican Page
- Dip toes in water with service injection to display politician metrics
    - https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/container
    - Look into pyscript to see if I should use matplotlib to display graphs for politician side


# Future things
- Make a javascriptless site

- Turn Campaign donors into pie graph (just like opensecrets)

- Share buttons for social media
    - Interactive filters for social media, such as the head tilts
    - Can also use this to skim more data and give better recommendations, "We think you will like this candidate more"

- Make the seeder.md table

- Allow Candidates to request a change of ballot

# Other programming stuff to look up
- Shortcut that will copy a line and paste it into current
