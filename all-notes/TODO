- Candidate ballot assignment on prod is 500, need to error check for no ballots
    - Do this by seeding like production and fix error

- Fix Candidate Poistions and promises, "add" can be in the same wire and should pop a modal

# Branch (Urgent) - Opinions Rework
- Test the following:
    - Candidate creating their stances
    
- Finish ability to edit candidate stances
    - Make a "delete stance" button

- Candidate profile page should only show the opinion if they have created a stance for it

# Bugs
- Flagging profile details on the candidate page will only save as one flag
- Need to put a "max content, read more" on the opinions reasoning and the bio
- Hitting "save stance" from the modal needs to close it
- Carousel focus should not refocus the page

# Branch (Urgent) - Admin Create/Edit Opinions Rework
- Need to be able to remove an opinion from a ballot

- Make edit opinions assign opinion ballots (admin side)
- Make create opinions create & edit on admin side

- Test the following:
    - Creating an opinion
    - Assigning the opinion to a ballot

# Branch (Urgent) - Promises Rework
- Need to reword the promises for now so that promises can be both promises for change or a promise to stand for a value. Add info tags to say that a promise might be about a promise to uphold a value or a promise for legislation change

# Branch (Urgent) - Candidate Profile Page Rework
- Need to do a "show more" on the candidates bio. I expect the candidates to have large bios. Should put a note that most people will not read extremely long bios.

# Branch (High) - Manual Candidate Creation
- Need to make an admin page to create the candidates profile if none of them decide to sign up

# Branch (High) - Model Rework
- Make sure that all model properties are in correct places (guarded vs fillable)
- Make sure that each model is being created correctly to reflect this
- Make sure that all attributes are correctly hidden like email, etc.
- Do some research into what attributes are necessary to hide

# Branch (High) - Information Rework
- Ballots should have an information type. This will be a list of information that appears on the ballot
- When a candidate runs for a certain position, different wording/information needs to appear
    - Controversial Opinions depend on the ballot, not the location
    - "Promises" should be "Promises to stand for the following beliefs" when dealing with congress
        - Might work around this by saying "This candidate promises to accomplish something in office, or promises to stand for the following beliefs"

# Branch - Testing
- Make a single candidate that I can run all tests for viewing profile on

- Admin Livewire Tests
    - User does show his profile
    - Approve new candidate
    - Candidate Ballot Assignment
    - Create a ballot
    - Permalinks
- End to end tests (dusk) for the following
    - User registers, then applies to become a candidate
        -> User is accepted
            -> User becomes a candidate, Fills out some info
        -> User edits their candidate profile, adds necessary info
            -> User cannot show
            -> User does not show on ballot
        -> Admin assigns Candidate to a ballot
        -> Candidate hits show
            -> Candidate appears on the ballot
            -> User can flag information from the candidate

# Views

## Home Page

## Candidate Page
- Polish up the candidate campaign videos
- Implement a carosel for the videos

## Ballot Page
- Make this look like textured paper

## My Profile Page

### Personal Information
- Allow the user to put in their zip, city, or state
    - Autofill this for them on the page? Or just make the buttons clickable
- Need to track amount of time a user spends on a page for candidate stats

### Jump back into

    - Use a cookie (don't store in db)

# Politican Page
- Dip toes in water with service injection to display politician metrics
    - https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/container

# Future things
- Make a javascriptless site

- Turn Campaign donors into pie graph (just like opensecrets)

- Make the seeder.md table

- Allow Candidates to request a change of ballot

# Other programming stuff to look up
- Shortcut that will copy a line and paste it into current
