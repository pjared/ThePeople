# Branch - Candidate Rework
- Need to include if a position is non partisan or not

- Candidate decides to show themselves on the ballot

- Decide how to add political leaning for the site
- Restructure Controversial opinions to account for the different positions (school district, etc)

- Need to finish photo upload
    - Determine if:
        - I can configure jetstream profile pictures to only be for candidates
        - Set their profile picture on the candidate profile
        - Look at jetstream page on profile photos, might be able to just use roles


- Allow the candidates to put an info for why they have a stance about an opinion

- Tell the candidate what ballot they've been assigned to.
    - Allow them to request a change (Later on)

- Candidates need a contact email and public email, contact phone and public phone
    - Make sure to configure this in admin assign candidates
    
- Figure out how political leanings work so I can implement them with the candidate

# Tests
- Make tests for the entire site with laravel dusk

## After fininshing team & role implementation

    - Can get this list from the cooks report

- Make about us page

- Make query builders for government websites for:
    - Laws voted on in office
    - Campaign Donations



# User Pivots
- Implement badges that appear during candidate hover & a key
    - Badges should also be on profile
    - Badges should only appear after verifcation, so politicians feel encouraged to join
    - Each badge needs to be it's own color
- Hovering over a law gives a summary, might need to find another site that does this

# Prompts to encourage registration

## My Profile Page

### Personal Information
- Allow the user to put in their zip, city, or state
    - if state is ever changed need to delete their votes and flags 
    - Autofill this for them on the page? Or just make the buttons clickable

### Jump back into
- Have a right side tab that will allow the user to go back to their study instead of manually doing the input
    - Use a login cookie so the data can be grabbed
    

# Politican Page
