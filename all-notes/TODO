## Candidate Profile Wire

# Teams

    - https://laracasts.com/discuss/channels/code-review/proper-way-to-disable-personal-teams-in-jetstream?page=1#reply=668759

- Finish logic for whether or not someone can create a team in [Team Policy :: create](app/Policies/TeamPolicy.php)
    - Candidates can create ONE team

# Tests
- Make tests for the entire site with laravel dusk
## After fininshing team & role implementation
- Make sure that basic users cannot access the following pages
    - Create a candidate

# MAIN TODO

    - Can get this list from the cooks report

- Make about us page
- Make query builders for government websites for:
    - Positions in office
    - Laws voted on in office
    - Campaign Donations

- Save the checkmark for the planned vote

# User Pivots
- Implement badges that appear during candidate hover & a key
    - Badges should also be on profile
    - Badges should only appear after verifcation, so politicians feel encouraged to join
    - Each badge needs to be it's own color
- Hovering over a law gives a summary, might need to find another site that does this

# Prompts to encourage registration
- Add sign up prompts for the following (https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/authentication#redirecting-unauthenticated-users)
    - Checking on ballot
    - Flagging

    - Create stickers under a candidate in the ballot so people can see basic info. 
    - Able to click to go to the candidate's page

- Send an async request when users choose their candidate

## My Profile Page

### Personal Information
- Allow the user to put in their zip, city, or state
    - if state is ever changed need to delete their votes and flags 
    - Autofill this for them on the page? Or just make the buttons clickable

### Jump back into
- Have a right side tab that will allow the user to go back to their study instead of manually doing the input
    - Use a login cookie so the data can be grabbed
    

# Politican Page
- Dip toes in water with service injection to display politician metrics
    - https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/container

# General Security

# Before going live
- Add validation errors for everything
