    - https://npratley.net/disabling-personal-teams-in-laravel-8-and-jetstream-1fd083593e08/
    - https://laracasts.com/discuss/channels/code-review/proper-way-to-disable-personal-teams-in-jetstream?page=1#reply=668759

# Tests
- Make tests for the entire site with laravel dusk

## After fininshing team & role implementation
- Make sure that basic users cannot access the following pages

    - Laws voted on in office
    - Campaign Donations

- Flash error messages on failure to update info in candidate profile edit

# User Pivots
- Implement badges that appear during candidate hover & a key
    - Badges should also be on profile
    - Badges should only appear after verifcation, so politicians feel encouraged to join
    - Each badge needs to be it's own color
- Hovering over a law gives a summary, might need to find another site that does this

# Prompts to encourage registration

- Send an async request when users choose their candidate

## My Profile Page

### Personal Information
- Allow the user to put in their zip, city, or state
    - if state is ever changed need to delete their votes and flags 
    - Autofill this for them on the page? Or just make the buttons clickable

### Jump back into
- Have a right side tab that will allow the user to go back to their study instead of manually doing the input
    - Use a login cookie so the data can be grabbed
    

# Politican Page
