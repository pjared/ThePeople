    - Include editing a location to have an opinion type

- Location needs a settable opinion type

- On admin create ballot, add in list generation as the person attempts to 
    - create a new location, ballot, or office
- Finish Candidate Ballot assignment
    - Ballot search bar
- Approving a candidate should bring you to a new page only for assigning them a ballot.

# Candidate Teams
- Do this after site launch, make teams work, look at sites below for help
    - https://npratley.net/disabling-personal-teams-in-laravel-8-and-jetstream-1fd083593e08/
    - https://laracasts.com/discuss/channels/code-review/proper-way-to-disable-personal-teams-in-jetstream?page=1#reply=668759
    - https://github.com/laravel/jetstream/issues/117
    - Create a team for the user with https://laracasts.com/discuss/channels/code-review/jetstream-how-to-programmatically-create-a-user-and-team 
- Finish logic for whether or not someone can create a team in [Team Policy :: create](app/Policies/TeamPolicy.php)
    - Candidates can create ONE team

# MAIN TODO
- Make about us page

- Programs for scraping/handling downloads off of gov't site
    - Laws voted on in office
    - Campaign Donations

- Flash error messages on failure to update info in candidate profile edit

- Allow for friends to share their flags

# User Pivots
- Implement badges that appear during candidate hover & a key
    - Badges should also be on profile
    - Badges should only appear after verifcation, so politicians feel encouraged to join
    - Each badge needs to be it's own color
    - Badges should be only generated when a candidate changes a stance
- Hovering over a law gives a summary, might need to find another site that does this

# Views

## Home Page

## Candidate Page
- Polish up the candidate campaign videos
- Implement a carosel for the videos
- Add icons to explain the opinions - these icons will match the badges on candidates

## Ballot Page
- Make this look like textured paper

## My Profile Page

### Personal Information
- Allow the user to put in their zip, city, or state
    - if state is ever changed queue to delete their votes and flags 
    - Autofill this for them on the page? Or just make the buttons clickable

### Jump back into
- Have a right side tab that will allow the user to go back to their study instead of manually doing the input
    - Use a cookie (don't store in db)

# Politican Page
- Dip toes in water with service injection to display politician metrics
    - https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/container
    - Look into pyscript to see if I should use matplotlib to display graphs for politician side

# General Security
- Need an analysis on all HTTP requests to make sure I use post when necessary

# Before going live
- Add validation errors for everything
    - https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/validation#quick-displaying-the-validation-errors

- Need to get down with service injection. 
    - https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/container

- Write Robots.txt file in public (don't allow anything, include an apology saying that this will be set up later)

# Future things
- Turn Campaign donors into pie graph (just like opensecrets)

- Share buttons for social media
    - Interactive filters for social media, such as the head tilts
    - Can also use this to skim more data and give better recommendations, "We think you will like this candidate more"

- Make the seeder.md table

- Allow Candidates to request a change of ballot

# Other programming stuff to look up
- Shortcut that will copy a line and paste it into current
