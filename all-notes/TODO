# Branch - Security Updates
- Need to figure out how to convert the candidate profile to a controller method
    - Flags stopped me from accomplishing as of 10/3

# Mobile Seach Bar
- Search results are not scrollablE

# Other
- Info button for the candidate compare page
- https://github.com/michael-rubel/livewire-best-practices

- Create share buttons to share the candidates you like
- Create a share button to share you voting list
- Set up open graph meta tags when I implement share buttons
- ALLOW USER TO SHARE CANDIDATE PERMALINK WITH A SHARE BUTTON

# Branch - Candidate/Ballot Model Changes
- Instead of calling the cache every time, use an observer for when candidate changes to 'show'
    - https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/eloquent#observers

# Branch - Groups
- Ability to share with others, but tracks how many unique link clicks there are
    - https://github.com/jorenvh/laravel-share
- Add a small box for description about why voting

# Branch - Flags
- Only load each flag when the content section is hovered

# Branch - Ballot names
- Might need to put a type on the office to use different styles for U.S. vs state offices

# UI
- Get a better color for buttons and warning label

# Branch - Slower Collapse
The 'collapse-animation' in pages.css and the '.collapse-open' in app.css were my first attmepts at making the collapse slower. After doing some online reading, the collapse animation is computationally expensive. I need to take the time to implement a different animation for this that involves scaling the content
- https://developer.chrome.com/blog/performant-expaannd-d-collapse/

# Branch - Candidate Page Rework
- Add pinned comments and photo section
- Users need to be able to see their comments

# Branch - Static Pages
- If a candidate signs up, going to have to add regeneration of static page for any model changes
    - Going to have to use model observers for this, for now can regen all

# Branch - Profile Rework
- Cache individual pieces for candidate
    - Ballot
    - Opinions, promises, etc
- Load each piece one at a time on page load

# Branch - High web traffic
- If ballot list and ballot candidates are taking too long, use defer loading
    - https://laravel-livewire.com/docs/2.x/defer-loading

- Decide what data to store in redis vs SQL
- Do more research into Octane

- Look into redis, and store the flag data and other needed data in the database
    - Store the candidate data on redis, but every time they update their data need to rewrite the block in redis

- Look into laravel Octane and swoole/roadrunner
    - Looks like forge has this already for easy set up

# Branch - Search functionality
- Associated cities:
    - Ballots need to contain the city names of who they apply to, so need to find a solution for this part

# Branch - Candidate Photos
- Might need to do photo resizing (filament has options for this)

# Branch - "Jump back into"
- Figure out how to save the current site of the user
- Add "jump back into" on home page

# Branch - Running candidate fix
- Ballot candidates() relation needs to just return the Candidate Class where running show is true
    - Fix the flag comparison and showballot wire, and other views that rely on this


# Branch - Required Opinion Sub-Stances
- https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/notifications#using-the-notifiable-trait
- Might want to change the current code of adding sub stances (code)[../app/Filament/Resources/RunningCandidatesResource.php]
    - Instead should make this event queued
    - Need to also notify the candidate that they have gotten another required stance (email?)

# Branch - User Voter Precincts
- Need to get the persons state for suggests?
- Get Suggestions
https://geocode.arcgis.com/arcgis/rest/services/World/GeocodeServer/suggest?maxSuggestions=5&outSR=%7B%22wkid%22%3A102100%7D&text=712%20S%20184&f=json

# Branch - Caching update
- Look at laravel observers (caching ballot, ballot list and candidate)
    - https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/eloquent#observers

## Manual Caching
- Add some buttons for the admin page to manually recache:
    - Ballot List
    - Candidate info
    - Ballot
- Include buttons to flush the cache
- This might be a lot easier to do with Laravel Horizon

## Cache Candidate
- Update: Waiting to do this since I can't think of a great way to add this to every resource

- Caching the user's flags will be necessary also
    - This one I can do if the user closes the dropdown, or leaves the area of controversial opinions after a change
- Look into caching the candidates information as it's being created
    - Does caching store on the browser tho? Might be a problem
    - https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/cache
    - https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/cache#retrieve-store
    - 'candidate-{$id}-stances'
    - Might also be able to store all of the candidate info in one cache
        - An events will create it by added all their caches together
        - Can do a test run with ballots to start
    - Could also start a timer on first candidate edit. every time they edit, timer resets. when timer finishes, the candidate is re-cached
        - keep a list of edited items, and redo cache for each part
        - Need to keep a cache of each section for candidate comparison


# Branch - Candidate Flags Comparison
- User should be able to hide candidates, put them in a list at the bottom
- Have a bottom bar(sticky) for the votes and the hidden candidates

- Need to do test for large amounts of candidates to make this look clean (later)

# Branch - Captcha
https://talltips.novate.co.uk/create-a-sliding-puzzle-captcha

# Branch - General

- Need to add grouping for candidate Events

- Widget to go to the youtube guides
- Keep count of page visits, unique page visits
- Bio save needs a session flash

- Remove the jetstream files that I haven't made any changes to

- Candidate positions are not showing include the filled out areas

- Create ability to message a candidate, that way we can analyze the messages and tell the candidates that they're missing out

# Candidate Stats
- Need to take a look at spatie analytics, it looks like google is already keeping count of everything for me
    - https://github.com/spatie/laravel-analytics
- Vote Count, and in comparison to running mates
- Conversion #
    - When a person who was originally voting for another candidate switched to them
        - Need to make sure that this doesn't happen when the user is initially playing with the ballot
        - When this happens on flag comparison page it's usefule
    - "UserVoteChange" Table

- Profile visits and average time spent on profile
    - Total #, non user & registered user visits
    - Keeping track of ballot visits will also be helpful for this one
    - Redirect count (QR code)

- How many users have signed up in a population

- Flag Stats
    - Total Flag count
    - Color of flags in pie chart
    - Notes from green flags, at first
        - Filter red notes with some kind of NLP sentiment reader

- "Why you voted for this candidate" on ballot page


# Branch - Testing
- Need to also run dusk tests as prod

- End to end tests for the following
    -> User edits their candidate profile, adds necessary info
        -> Candidate hits show
            -> Candidate appears on the ballot
            -> User can flag information from the candidate

- Make sure that user can save their votes for a ballot
    -> User votes for a candidate
    -> User refreshes pagesa
        ->Vote should still be there

- Make sure flags are saved
    -> User clicks on a flag
    -> User refreshes page
        -> Flag should still be there


- Admin Livewire Tests
    - User does show his profile

    - Don't have to use specific wording, "enforce carbon tax", but can make them take a side

# Branch - Candidate Traits
- Need to just make a trait for the candidate instead of having a billion associated models
    - HasEvents

# Ballot Page
- Make this look like textured paper

- uptime monitoring for notifying when site is down (uptimeRobot)

- User Votes needs an isValid? Or do I just want to check the state that the user has included

- Make a setting to change whether or not the dropdown indicators appear
    - The dropdowns on the opinions make the page a lot less intuitive

- Can message the candidate from the site, but then we can use the message data to see what people feel about the candidate

- Put a link to state government

# Branch - Laws Passed
- Create a list of psuedo laws that ask strong moral questions
    - Similar to the "you gain invisibility, but can only stand still while invisible"
    - Take from real laws "money diverted to schools instead of homelessness"
- The users that sign up also vote on these laws, and the candidates most similar to them will appear on the top of the ballot

# Branch (Low) - Information Rework
- Ballots should have an information type. This will be a list of information that appears on the ballot
    - If there is a school union board, the candidates will have different information to fill out
    - When a candidate runs for a certain position, different wording/information needs to appear
        - Controversial Opinions depend on the ballot, not the location
        - "Promises" should be "Promises to stand for the following beliefs" when dealing with congress
            - Might work around this by saying "This candidate promises to accomplish something in office, or promises to stand for the following beliefs"

# Admin Page, Future additions
- A lot of these below will be handled with a proper admin panel
    - Decide how to handle rejected candidates
        - Have a search bar to unreject
