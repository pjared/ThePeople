# Branch - Mailing
- Mail candidates when application has been updated

# Branch - Flag Comparison
- Show users a page of flags for their ballots

# Branch - Testing
- End to end tests (dusk) for the following
    - User signs up, then applies to become a candidate
    - User becomes a candidate, assigned to a ballot
        - Appears on new ballot
    - User edits their candidate profile, adds necessary info
        - User does not hit show
        - User does show his profile
    - Admin
        - Approve new candidate
        - Candidate Ballot Assignment
        - Create a ballot
        - Permalinks

# Branch - Model Rework
- Make sure that all model properties are in correct places (guarded vs fillable)
- Make sure that each model is being created correctly to reflect this
- Make sure that all attributes are correctly hidden like email, etc.â€™

# Branch - Admin Update (Finish Later)
- In create ballot:
    - Show existing locations, office, and ballots as it's being typed
- Decide how to handle rejected candidates
    - Have a search bar to unreject
- Each admin page needs to be componetized so creation of each model is it's own wire
- The following pages need to have null checks
    - Candidate edit page needs to have a check for when a person accesses the link without a candidate
    - Admin/candidate-assignment

# General Lists
- Add a search bar for users to find candidates
    - Look into caching to implement this

- Print out/save list of planned votes

- Add a comparison page that pulls the users flags

- As candidate profile gets more detailed, componetize each section

- Mobile and large screen support

- Show flag count under candidate in ballot

- User flag works, but needs major optimization
    - Should batch all changes and then submit as one when user hovers out of card
- Signing in takes to home page
- Find out how to ensure that a user's input state ties to their votes, etc.

- tooltip hover to see the description of opinions

- Give badges actual icons

- Need to make info tags for everything on the site

- Make better videos to show the candidates how to create a profile.

- Make admin home page into a grid
- Allow users to choose a profile photo?

- Set Opinion votes amount (hardcoded for now)

- Candidate show blade
    - Make candidate bio look better

- Send email notifications to my gmail when a new candidate applies, etc.

- Add a button to go to profile page from profile and edit page

- Change ballot card
    - Daisy component "hero"
    - Figure out the profile picture look

- Make sure to actually block users from profile photos.

## Hard
- CandidateEditProfile
    - Promises should show up immediately (this is a tough one)

## Admin Page - Future additions
- Admin Page for:
    - Generate a QR code (Do this with official logo later, for now just use some random thing)
- ALLOW USER TO SHARE CANDIDATE PERMALINK WITH A SHARE BUTTON (should include flags?)

- On admin create ballot, add in list generation as the person attempts to 
    - create a new location, ballot, or office
- Finish Candidate Ballot assignment
    - Ballot search bar
- Approving a candidate should bring you to a new page only for assigning them a ballot.

# Candidate Teams
- Do this after site launch, make teams work, look at sites below for help
    - https://npratley.net/disabling-personal-teams-in-laravel-8-and-jetstream-1fd083593e08/
    - https://laracasts.com/discuss/channels/code-review/proper-way-to-disable-personal-teams-in-jetstream?page=1#reply=668759
    - https://github.com/laravel/jetstream/issues/117
    - Create a team for the user with https://laracasts.com/discuss/channels/code-review/jetstream-how-to-programmatically-create-a-user-and-team 
- Finish logic for whether or not someone can create a team in [Team Policy::create](app/Policies/TeamPolicy.php)
    - Candidates can create ONE team

# MAIN TODO
- Make about us page

- Programs for scraping/handling downloads off of gov't site
    - Laws voted on in office
    - Campaign Donations

- Flash error messages on failure to update info in candidate profile edit

- Allow for friends to share their flags

# User Pivots
- Implement badges that appear during candidate hover & a key
    - Badges should also be on profile
    - Badges should only appear after verifcation, so politicians feel encouraged to join
    - Each badge needs to be it's own color
    - Badges should be only generated when a candidate changes a stance
- Hovering over a law gives a summary, might need to find another site that does this

# Views

## Home Page

## Candidate Page
- Polish up the candidate campaign videos
- Implement a carosel for the videos
- Add icons to explain the opinions - these icons will match the badges on candidates

## Ballot Page
- Make this look like textured paper

## My Profile Page

### Personal Information
- Allow the user to put in their zip, city, or state
    - if state is ever changed queue to delete their votes and flags 
    - Autofill this for them on the page? Or just make the buttons clickable

### Jump back into
- Have a right side tab that will allow the user to go back to their study instead of manually doing the input
    - Use a cookie (don't store in db)

# Politican Page
- Dip toes in water with service injection to display politician metrics
    - https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/container
    - Look into pyscript to see if I should use matplotlib to display graphs for politician side

# General Security
- Need an analysis on all HTTP requests to make sure I use post when necessary

# Before going live
- Add validation errors for everything
    - https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/validation#quick-displaying-the-validation-errors

- Need to get down with service injection. 
    - https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/container

- Write Robots.txt file in public (don't allow anything, include an apology saying that this will be set up later)

# Future things
- Turn Campaign donors into pie graph (just like opensecrets)

- Share buttons for social media
    - Interactive filters for social media, such as the head tilts
    - Can also use this to skim more data and give better recommendations, "We think you will like this candidate more"

- Make the seeder.md table

- Allow Candidates to request a change of ballot

# Other programming stuff to look up
- Shortcut that will copy a line and paste it into current
