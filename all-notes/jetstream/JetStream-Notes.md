# My notes for jetstream

This is the first time I am using a full stack application and I plan on keeping notes to help me navigate this shit.

## Dashboard
Logging in will automatically direct you to the dashboard, so here I can
- Have a seperate page for users to pull up elections near them

## Location-Input
- The querystring "except" parameter not working, bandaid fix in view

## Teams
JetStream teams docs are found at https://jetstream.laravel.com/2.x/features/teams.html#introduction

An important file for me is the TeamPolicy.php, here is where the settings for jetstream is. This file puts restrictions/capabilities on teams.
